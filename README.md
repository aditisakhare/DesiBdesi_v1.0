# DesiBdesi_v1.0
We participated in Rajasthan Hackathon 4.0. Our solution majorly focuses on issues faced by tourists, local guides &amp; small-scale Entrepreneurs. We are providing a pooling system for small scale entrepreneurs to bridge the gap between handicraft manufacturers &amp; buyers by forming groups based on their location, ratings &amp; products they manufacture. We also have a local guide allocation system for tourists to plan their vacation in the most efficient way and make most of their time in one particular state.
